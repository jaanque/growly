  All section-specific styles (header-section, next-section, how-it-works-section, etc.)
  and their child element styles (header-title, feature-item, step-icon, form-input, etc.)
  have been moved to their respective component CSS files:
  - src/components/Header.css
  - src/components/WhatIsCarfli.css
  - src/components/HowItWorks.css
  - src/components/WhyCarfli.css
  - src/components/JoinRevolution.css

  Media queries related to these sections have also been moved to their corresponding
  component CSS files to keep styles modular and maintainable.
